# telegram2whatsapp

This is a simple bot that forwards messages from a Telegram group to a WhatsApp group.

## How to use it

1. Create a Telegram bot and get the token. You can follow the instructions [here](https://core.telegram.org/bots#6-botfather).
2. Create a WhatsApp group and get the group ID. You can follow the instructions [here](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/chats/how-to-find-the-group-link-or-id).
3. Edit the example.env file with the following information:
    - BOT_TOKEN=get from bot father
    - CHANNEL1_ID=channel from msg to fetch
    - CHANNEL2_ID=channel to store msg
    - ADMIN=admin whatsapp id 
    - GROUPS=groups id in a string

4. Rename the example.env file to .env.
5. Run the following commands:
    ```bash
    npm install
    npm start
    ```

## How it works

The bot will fetch the messages from the Telegram group and send them to the WhatsApp group. It will also send the media files (photos, videos, documents, etc.) and the replies to the messages.
